# London Fire Brigade Sample Application

This application illustrates how you can embed visual analytics into your data applications using ChartFactor. We use basic HTML/Javascript instead of a framework such as React JS for illustration simplicity. 

The dataset you visualize in this application consists of 32K calls to the London Fire Brigade from January 01 to April 30 2017.

View the application online at https://chartfactor.com/london-fire-brigade/. You can also view our [video tutorial](https://chartfactor.com/doc/latest/tutorials/visual_analytics_fundamentals/#class-4-embedding) for step-by-step instructions.

For an example of embedding visual analytics in a React JS application, please refer to our [Real Estate Market Statistics application](https://github.com/Aktiun/real-estate-mkt-stats).

## Running the application locally

All you need to do is to place the code on a web server. An easy way is to start a python web server on this folder. Example:

```
python -m http.server 8080
```
